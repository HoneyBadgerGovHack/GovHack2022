There are five files containing the data displayed in the BITRE Congestion Report, three csv files and one geojson. The file containing route parameters can be found at the github repository at github.com/bitre-telematics/congestion.
The five files are:

`route_metrics.csv`: Containing summary data on each route, with the fields
- route_name - name of route in report
-  min median travel time - the lowest median travel time (by hour) for the route
-  max median travel time - the highest median traveltime (by hour) for the route
-  Peak time to best ratio - The ratio of longest to shortest median time
-  min iq travel time - the interquartile range width for the hour in which is was most narrow
-  max iq travel time - the interquartile range width for the hour in which is was most wide
-  Peak iq to best ratio - the ratio of the widest to most narrow iq ranges
-  min median travel hour - the hour of day (from 0 to 23) when median travel times were least
-  max median travel hour - the hour of day (from 0 to 23) when median travel times were greatest
-  min iq travel hour - the hour of day for which the iq range was narrowest
-  max iq travel hour - the hour of day for which the iq range was greatest
-  total obvs - the number of vehicle observations used to calculate all time
-  Mean excess time ratio - the arithmetic mean of the ratio, by hour, of travel times to the best travel time
-  Mean excess time ratio - weighted - the arithmetic mean of the ratio, by hour, of travel times to the best travel time, weighted by observations in that   hour - hour of the day (from 0 to 23)
-  Mean excess iq ratio - the arithmetic mean of the ratio, by hour, of iq ranges to the best iq range
-  Mean excess iq ratio - weighted - the arithmetic mean of the ratio, by hour, of iq ranges to the best iq range, weighted by observations in that hour
-  distance - the length of the route in metres

`route_times.csv`: Containing data for each hour, as graphed in the report, with the fields
-  route_name - name of route
-  hour - hour of the day (from 0 to 23)
-  LQ_est - the travel time at the lowest quartile of speeds (that is the upper quartile of travel times) in seconds
-  med_est - the travel time at the median travel speeds in seconds
-  UQ_est - the travel time at the upper quartile of speeds (that is the lower quartile of travel times) in seconds
-  LQ_est_char, med_est_char, UQ_est_char - the above but in human readable format
-  n_obvs - the number of vehicle observations used to caculate the speeds for that hour

`segment_summary.csv`: containing summaries of the segments and their speeds used to calculate travel times
-  route_name - the name of the route this data was generated for
-  osm_id - an Open Street Map unqiue indentifier, valid at least at time of publication. A segment may appear in more than one route.
-  hour - hour of day (from 0 to 23)
-  n_obvs - the number of vehicle observations available for that hour and segment. This may be 0 in some cases in which case alternate methods were used to assume a distribution of speeds
-  speed_limit - the speed limit. This report assumes all vehicles obey the speed limit. This was taken from OpenStreetMap where available and assumed based on road class and observed speed in others.
-  UQ - the upper quartile of speed (kph)
-  median - the median speed (kph)
-  LQ - the lower quartile of speed (sph)
-  distance - the distance traversed on this segment by the route - a segment may be used for different lengths on different routes

The file `geometries.csv` contains only whole route geometries. Individual segments can be obtained from OpenStreetMap.

`city_wide_indices_2020.csv`: contains index values for the 5 cities, indexed to year 2019
-  mean_excess_time - the mean of the METR (as in route_metrics.csv) weighted by the product of total observations and the distance of the trip
-  mean_uncert_odw - the mean of the MEUR (as in route_metrics.csv) weighted by the product of total observations and the distance of the trip
-  mean_excess_time_odw_hw - the mean of the METR - weighted (as in route_metrics.csv) weighted by the product of total observations and the distance of the trip
-  mean_uncert_odw_hw - the mean of the MEUR - weighted (as in route_metrics.csv) weighted by the product of total observations and the distance of the trip
-  year - the year of the observation
-  route_sample - the year for which the observation comprises of comparable routes. For 2021 new routes were added to Melbourne and Sydney, so values of the indices for that year were calculated with the original 2019 sample as well.
